## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is **Kewish Fagoe** and I'm a software developer. Currently working with Java and PostgreSQL. I like building websites and web applications. Previously worked on a lot of websites built with PHP and MySQL. Trying to lose fat and failing miserably. Avid videogamer and huge food lover (obviously). Figuring out more focused learning and creative output. ðŸŒ±

âš¡ _Fun tidbit_: I love building with Legos in my spare time.

## Get in touch ðŸ’¬
I'd love to hear about your experiences as a developer, favorite videogames or anything tech related really. ðŸ˜„
